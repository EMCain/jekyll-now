title: About Emily
---


I'm a programmer, writer, and software educator. I currently work at New Relic making instructional content for [New Relic University](https://learn.newrelic.com). All opinions on this site are my own and do not reflect the views of my employer.

I've worked with Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, and SQL. I'm working on [a Twitter bot that creates pharmaceutical ads](https://www.twitter.com/AskYrDoctorABot) and learning to make games in Unity.

I write about software, IT security, and how people learn about them.

When I'm not working with tech, I enjoy riding bikes, lifting weights, board games, hiking, and volunteering.

You can find me on Twitter as [\@data_bae](https://www.twitter.com/) and on GitHub as [EMCain](https://www.github.com/emcain).
