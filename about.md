title: About Emily
---


I'm a programmer, writer, and software educator. I currently work at New Relic
as a developer on our Security Automation Team. All opinions on this site are my
 own and do not reflect the views of my employer.

I've worked with Python, Go, PHP, Ruby, and SQL. I'm working on [a Twitter bot that creates pharmaceutical ads](https://www.twitter.com/AskYrDoctorABot) and learning to make games in Unity.

I write about software, IT security, and how people learn about them.

When I'm not working with tech, I enjoy riding bikes, lifting weights, board games, hiking, and volunteering.

You can find me on GitHub as [EMCain](https://www.github.com/emcain). I have a
Twitter account at [@data_bae](https://www.twitter.com/), but it's inactive now.
